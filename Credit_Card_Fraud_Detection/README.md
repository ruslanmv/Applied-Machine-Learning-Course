# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection module of the Applied Machine Learning Course!

## Motivation

Credit card fraud is a significant problem for both financial institutions and individuals. Fraudulent transactions can lead to substantial financial losses, damage to credit scores, and a loss of trust in the financial system. Detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial for minimizing these negative impacts. Machine learning provides powerful tools to identify patterns and anomalies that can indicate fraud.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the challenges of credit card fraud detection.
*   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit card transaction dataset.
*   Handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE).
*   Train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression and Isolation Forest for fraud detection.
*   Understand and apply anomaly detection techniques.
*   Use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for fraud detection.
*   Interpret the results of the models and understand the trade-offs between different evaluation metrics.

## Real-World Applications

*   **Financial Institutions:** Banks and credit card companies use fraud detection models to automatically flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
*   **E-commerce:** Online retailers use these techniques to prevent fraudulent purchases.
*   **Insurance:** Insurance companies can apply similar methods to detect fraudulent claims.
*   **Cybersecurity:** Anomaly detection techniques can be used to identify unusual patterns in network traffic that might indicate a security breach.

## Conceptual Overview

Credit card fraud detection is typically framed as a **classification** problem, where we aim to classify transactions as either legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1). However, it also has elements of **anomaly detection** because fraudulent transactions are often outliers that deviate significantly from the normal patterns of legitimate transactions.

Key challenges in this domain include:

*   **Class Imbalance:** Fraudulent transactions are typically a very small percentage of the total transactions, making the dataset highly imbalanced.
*   **Concept Drift:** Fraudsters constantly adapt their techniques, so models need to be updated regularly to maintain accuracy.
*   **Real-time Requirements:** Fraud detection systems often need to operate in real-time or near real-time to prevent losses.

We will explore two main approaches:

1.  **Classification:** Using models like Logistic Regression to classify transactions based on learned patterns from labeled data.
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Using techniques like Isolation Forest to identify transactions that are significantly different from the majority of the data.

## Tools

*   **Python:** Our primary programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
*   **Imbalanced-learn (imblearn):** For handling class imbalance using oversampling techniques (SMOTE).
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

## Dataset

We will use a publicly available **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset**.

*   **Source:** You can find it on [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
*   **Description:** The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.
*   **Features:** Due to confidentiality issues, the dataset provides only numerical input variables which are the result of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. Features V1, V2, ..., V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA. The only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' (seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset) and 'Amount' (transaction amount). The target variable is 'Class' (1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise).
*   **Potential Limitations:** The PCA transformation obscures the original features, making it harder to interpret the results in terms of real-world variables. Also, the dataset is from 2013, so fraud patterns might have evolved since then.

## Project Roadmap

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the dataset, understand its structure, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values (if any) and scale numerical features.
3.  **Handling Class Imbalance:** Apply oversampling using SMOTE to balance the dataset.
4.  **Model Training:** Train a Logistic Regression and an Isolation Forest model.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, AUC).
6.  **Interpretation and Insights:** Analyze the models' results to understand the factors contributing to fraud detection.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Get basic information about the dataset
print(data.info())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Visualize the distribution of the target variable (Class)
sns.countplot(x='Class', data=data)
plt.show()

# Describe the 'Amount' and 'Time' features
print(data[['Amount', 'Time']].describe())
````

**Explanation:**

  * We import the necessary libraries.
  * We load the dataset using Pandas.
  * We examine the first few rows, data types, and check for missing values.
  * We visualize the distribution of the "Class" column to highlight the class imbalance.
  * We examine the descriptive statistics of the 'Amount' and 'Time' features.

### 2\. Data Preprocessing

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Scale 'Amount' and 'Time' features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['Amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
data['Time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Time'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

print(data[['Amount', 'Time']].describe())
```

**Explanation:**

  * We use `StandardScaler` to standardize the 'Amount' and 'Time' features. This ensures that features with larger values don't disproportionately influence the model. We apply the same scaling to both training and test sets using the scaler fitted on the training set.

### 3\. Handling Class Imbalance

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']

# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Check the class distribution after oversampling
print(pd.Series(y_resampled).value_counts())
```

**Explanation:**

  * We separate the features (X) from the target variable (y).
  * We use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create synthetic samples for the minority class (fraudulent transactions). This helps to balance the class distribution and improve model performance.

### 4\. Model Training

#### Logistic Regression

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Split the resampled data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Logistic Regression model
lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_lr = lr_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print("Logistic Regression Results:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_lr))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_lr), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.show()
```

#### Isolation Forest

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Initialize and train an Isolation Forest model
iso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42) # Assuming 5% are anomalies
iso_forest.fit(X_train) # Fit on the training data

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_iso = iso_forest.predict(X_test)

# Convert predictions to 0 (normal) and 1 (anomaly)
y_pred_iso[y_pred_iso == 1] = 0
y_pred_iso[y_pred_iso == -1] = 1

# Evaluate the model
print("\nIsolation Forest Results:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_iso))
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_iso), annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

  * **Logistic Regression:**
      * We split the oversampled data into training and testing sets.
      * We initialize a `LogisticRegression` model and train it using the training data.
      * We make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using the classification report and confusion matrix.
  * **Isolation Forest:**
      * We initialize an `IsolationForest` model. The `contamination` parameter is an estimate of the proportion of outliers in the data set.
      * We fit the model on the training data.
      * We make predictions on the test set. Isolation Forest returns -1 for anomalies and 1 for normal instances. We convert these to 1 and 0, respectively, to match our target variable encoding.
      * We evaluate the model using the classification report and confusion matrix.

### 5\. Model Evaluation

We have already printed the classification reports and displayed the confusion matrices for both models in the previous step. Now, let's discuss how to interpret these results and compare the models.

  * **Precision:** Out of all the transactions predicted as fraudulent, what proportion were actually fraudulent?
  * **Recall:** Out of all the actual fraudulent transactions, what proportion were correctly identified by the model?
  * **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between the two metrics.
  * **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between the two classes.

**Choosing the right metric:** In fraud detection, **recall is often more important than precision**. It is generally more costly to miss a fraudulent transaction (false negative) than to flag a legitimate transaction as fraudulent (false positive). However, a very low precision can lead to a high number of false alarms, which can be costly and inconvenient. Therefore, we need to find a balance between recall and precision, and the F1-score can be a useful metric for this purpose.

### 6\. Interpretation and Insights

For the Logistic Regression model, we can examine the coefficients to get an idea of which features are most strongly associated with fraudulent transactions:

```python
# Get feature names
feature_names = X.columns

# Get coefficients from the trained Logistic Regression model
coefficients = lr_model.coef_[0]

# Create a DataFrame to display feature names and their coefficients
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Coefficient': coefficients})

# Sort the DataFrame by coefficient values
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values(by='Coefficient', ascending=False)

# Display the top features
print("\nFeature Importance (Logistic Regression):\n", feature_importance)
```

**Explanation:**

  * We retrieve feature names and coefficients from the trained Logistic Regression model.
  * We create a DataFrame to store feature names and their coefficients.
  * We sort the DataFrame by coefficient magnitude.
  * We print the sorted DataFrame to see which features have the strongest positive or negative association with fraudulent transactions.

**Note:** Because the features in this dataset have been anonymized using PCA, it is difficult to interpret them directly in a real-world context.

## Exercises

1.  **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with different parameters for Logistic Regression (e.g., `C`, `penalty`) and Isolation Forest (e.g., `contamination`, `n_estimators`) to see if you can improve performance.
2.  **Different Oversampling/Undersampling:** Try other techniques like undersampling the majority class or using a combination of oversampling and undersampling.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**  Create new features that might be relevant for fraud detection. For instance, you could engineer features related to the frequency or amount of transactions within certain time windows.
4.  **Other Models:** Explore other classification models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines.

## Suggested Solutions (Hints)

  * **Exercise 1:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` from Scikit-learn to automate the process of parameter tuning.
  * **Exercise 2:** The `imblearn` library provides various oversampling and undersampling techniques.
  * **Exercise 3:** Think about how transaction patterns might differ between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. You can use Pandas' `groupby()` and `rolling()` functions for time-based aggregations.
  * **Exercise 4:** Scikit-learn provides implementations of many classification algorithms.

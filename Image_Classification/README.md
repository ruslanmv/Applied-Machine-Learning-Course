# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Welcome to the Image Classification module of the Applied Machine Learning Course!

## Motivation

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous applications, from self-driving cars and medical diagnosis to security systems and content moderation. The ability to automatically categorize images accurately has revolutionized various industries. This module will introduce you to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the state-of-the-art technique for image classification.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the basics of image representation and processing.
*   Understand the architecture and key components of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
*   Build, train, and evaluate CNN models for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
*   Apply techniques like data augmentation to improve model performance.
*   Interpret the results of image classification and visualize model predictions.

## Real-World Applications

*   **Medical Diagnosis:** Classifying medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) to detect diseases.
*   **Self-Driving Cars:** Identifying objects like pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs.
*   **Facial Recognition:** Unlocking phones, identifying individuals in photos or videos.
*   **Object Detection:** Detecting and classifying objects in images or video streams.
*   **Image Search:**  Categorizing and tagging images for efficient search and retrieval.
*   **Quality Control:** Identifying defects in manufactured products.

## Conceptual Overview

**Image Representation:** Images are represented as grids of pixels, where each pixel has a numerical value representing its intensity or color. Color images typically have three channels (Red, Green, Blue), while grayscale images have one.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are a specialized type of neural network designed to process grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn hierarchical features from images.

**Key Components of a CNN:**

*   **Convolutional Layers:** Apply filters (kernels) to the input image to extract features like edges, corners, and textures.
*   **Activation Functions (e.g., ReLU):** Introduce non-linearity to the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.
*   **Pooling Layers (e.g., Max Pooling):** Downsample the feature maps, reducing their size and computational cost while retaining the most important information.
*   **Fully Connected Layers:**  Flatten the output of the convolutional layers and use traditional neural network layers to classify the image.
*   **Output Layer:** Produces the final classification probabilities (e.g., using a softmax function).

## Tools

*   **Python:** Our primary programming language.
*   **TensorFlow:** A powerful open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning.
*   **Keras:** A high-level API for building and training neural networks, built on top of TensorFlow.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
*   **OpenCV (cv2)**: optional, for image operations

## Datasets

In this module, we will use one of the following datasets:

### CIFAR-10

*   **Description:** A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
*   **Classes:** Airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
*   **Source:** [CIFAR-10 Website](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

### MNIST

*   **Description:** A dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image is 28x28 grayscale.
*   **Source:** [MNIST Website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

We will focus on **CIFAR-10** for this module, as it presents a slightly more challenging problem than MNIST due to color images and more complex object categories.

## Project Roadmap

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the CIFAR-10 dataset, understand its structure, and visualize sample images.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize pixel values and one-hot encode the labels.
3.  **Model Building:** Create a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
4.  **Model Training:** Train the CNN model on the training data.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
6.  **Data Augmentation:** Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.
7.  **Interpretation and Visualization:** Analyze the model's predictions and visualize misclassified images.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()

# Class names
class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']

# Explore the dataset
print("x_train shape:", x_train.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("x_test shape:", x_test.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)

# Visualize some sample images
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5, 5, i + 1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(x_train[i])
    plt.xlabel(class_names[y_train[i][0]])
plt.show()
````

**Explanation:**

  * We import the necessary libraries (TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy).
  * We load the CIFAR-10 dataset using `keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()`.
  * We print the shapes of the training and testing sets to understand the structure of the data.
  * We visualize a few sample images along with their labels using Matplotlib.

### 2\. Data Preprocessing

```python
# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0

# One-hot encode the labels
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
```

**Explanation:**

  * **Normalization:** We divide the pixel values by 255.0 to normalize them to the range \[0, 1]. This helps improve model training.
  * **One-Hot Encoding:** We convert the labels (which are integers from 0 to 9) into one-hot encoded vectors. For example, the label 3 becomes \[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. This is the format required for categorical cross-entropy loss.

### 3\. Model Building

```python
# Build the CNN model
model = keras.models.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),
    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    keras.layers.Flatten(),
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print model summary
model.summary()
```

**Explanation:**

  * **Model Architecture:**
      * We create a `Sequential` model in Keras.
      * **Convolutional Layers:** We add three convolutional layers with increasing numbers of filters (32, 64, 128).
          * `filters`: The number of filters (kernels) to learn.
          * `kernel_size`: The size of the filters (3x3 in this case).
          * `activation='relu'`: We use the ReLU activation function.
          * `padding='same'`: We add padding to maintain the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
          * `input_shape`: Specifies the shape of the input images (32x32x3 for CIFAR-10).
      * **Max Pooling Layers:** We add max pooling layers after each convolutional layer to downsample the feature maps.
          * `pool_size`: The size of the pooling window (2x2 in this case).
      * **Flatten Layer:** We flatten the output of the last pooling layer into a 1D vector.
      * **Dense Layers:** We add two fully connected (dense) layers.
          * The first dense layer has 128 units and uses ReLU activation.
          * The second dense layer (output layer) has 10 units (one for each class) and uses the `softmax` activation function to produce probability scores for each class.
  * **Compilation:**
      * `optimizer='adam'`: We use the Adam optimizer, a popular choice for training neural networks.
      * `loss='categorical_crossentropy'`: We use categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, which is appropriate for multi-class classification.
      * `metrics=['accuracy']`: We monitor the accuracy during training.
  * **Model Summary:** We print a summary of the model architecture, showing the layers, output shapes, and number of parameters.

### 4\. Model Training

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

**Explanation:**

  * We train the model using `model.fit()`.
      * `x_train`, `y_train`: The training data and labels.
      * `epochs=20`: The number of times to iterate over the entire training dataset.
      * `batch_size=64`: The number of samples to process in each batch.
      * `validation_data=(x_test, y_test)`: The test data and labels, used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch.
  * The `fit()` method returns a `history` object that stores the training metrics (loss and accuracy) for each epoch.

### 5\. Model Evaluation

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc:.4f}")

# Plot training history (accuracy and loss)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')

plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

  * We evaluate the trained model on the test data using `model.evaluate()`.
  * We print the test accuracy.
  * We plot the training and validation accuracy and loss curves over the epochs using Matplotlib. This helps visualize how the model is learning and whether it's overfitting.

### 6\. Data Augmentation

```python
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Create an ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=15,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
)

# Fit the data generator on the training data
datagen.fit(x_train)

# Train the model with data augmentation
history_augmented = model.fit(datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=64),
                              epochs=20,
                              validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model trained with data augmentation
test_loss_aug, test_acc_aug = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print(f"Test accuracy (with augmentation): {test_acc_aug:.4f}")
```

**Explanation:**

  * We create an `ImageDataGenerator` object from Keras, which will perform data augmentation on the fly during training.
      * `rotation_range=15`: Randomly rotate images by up to 15 degrees.
      * `width_shift_range=0.1`: Randomly shift images horizontally by up to 10% of the width.
      * `height_shift_range=0.1`: Randomly shift images vertically by up to 10% of the height.
      * `horizontal_flip=True`: Randomly flip images horizontally.
  * We fit the data generator on the training data using `datagen.fit(x_train)`. This calculates any statistics needed for the transformations.
  * We train the model again, but this time we use `datagen.flow(x_train, y_train, batch_size=64)` to provide augmented batches of training data during each epoch.
  * We evaluate the model trained with data augmentation on the test data.

### 7\. Interpretation and Visualization

```python
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
y_pred_classes = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)
y_true = np.argmax(y_test, axis=1)

# Visualize some misclassified images
misclassified_indices = np.where(y_pred_classes != y_true)[0]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i, index in enumerate(misclassified_indices[:25]):
    plt.subplot(5, 5, i + 1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(x_test[index])
    plt.xlabel(f"True: {class_names[y_true[index]]}\nPredicted: {class_names[y_pred_classes[index]]}")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

  * We make predictions on the test set using `model.predict()`.
  * We convert the predicted probabilities into class labels using `np.argmax()`.
  * We find the indices of misclassified images.
  * We visualize some of the misclassified images along with their true and predicted labels using Matplotlib. This can help us understand what kinds of images the model is struggling with.

## Exercises

1.  **Different Model Architectures:** Experiment with different CNN architectures. Try adding more convolutional layers, changing the number of filters, using different kernel sizes, or adding dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. You can use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameter values.
3.  **Different Activation Functions:** Experiment with different activation functions, such as Leaky ReLU or Parametric ReLU.
4.  **Advanced Data Augmentation:** Explore more advanced data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, zooming, or color adjustments.
5.  **Transfer Learning:** Use a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) as a starting point and fine-tune it on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This can often lead to better performance, especially when you have limited training data.

## Suggested Solutions (Hints)

  * **Exercise 1:** Refer to the Keras documentation for different layer types and options.
  * **Exercise 2:** You can manually try different hyperparameter values or use libraries like Keras Tuner or Talos for automated hyperparameter optimization.
  * **Exercise 3:**  Refer to the Keras documentation for available activation functions.
  * **Exercise 4:** The `ImageDataGenerator` supports various augmentation options. You can also use libraries like Albumentations for more advanced augmentations.
  * **Exercise 5:** Keras provides pre-trained models in `keras.applications`. You can load a pre-trained model, remove its top layers (classification layers), add your own classification layers, and fine-tune the model on your dataset.

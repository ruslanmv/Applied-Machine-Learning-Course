# Loan Eligibility Prediction

Welcome to the Loan Eligibility Prediction module of the Applied Machine Learning Course!

## Motivation

Predicting loan eligibility is a crucial task for financial institutions. Accurately assessing whether an applicant is likely to repay a loan helps banks and lenders make informed lending decisions, manage risk, and ensure profitability. Machine learning techniques can automate and improve the accuracy of this process, leading to faster loan approvals and reduced losses due to defaults.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

*   Understand the problem of loan eligibility prediction and its importance in the financial industry.
*   Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on loan application data.
*   Preprocess data for machine learning, including handling missing values and categorical features.
*   Train and evaluate classification models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees for loan eligibility prediction.
*   Understand and interpret the results of these models, including feature importance.
*   Use Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for loan eligibility prediction.

## Real-World Applications

*   **Banks and Lending Institutions:** Automating loan application processing, assessing credit risk, and making lending decisions.
*   **Fintech Companies:** Building online loan platforms that can instantly evaluate loan eligibility.
*   **Credit Scoring:** Developing credit scoring models to assess the creditworthiness of individuals.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Lending:** Facilitating loan approvals on P2P lending platforms.

## Conceptual Overview

Loan eligibility prediction is a **binary classification** problem. We aim to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan (e.g., "Yes" or "No", 1 or 0) based on various features related to the applicant and the loan.

We will explore two commonly used classification algorithms:

1.  **Logistic Regression:** A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It's a simple yet effective method for classification and provides probabilities of loan eligibility.
2.  **Decision Trees:** A tree-like model that makes decisions based on a series of if-then-else rules learned from the data. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can capture non-linear relationships in the data.

## Tools

*   **Python:** Our primary programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating machine learning models.
*   **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
*   **Seaborn:** For statistical data visualization.
*   **Excel or Google Sheets:** You may want to use a spreadsheet program for initial data exploration and understanding.

## Dataset

We will use a Loan Prediction dataset, which is a common dataset used for practice.

*   **Source:** You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, or find similar datasets on platforms like Kaggle. Here's a link to a suitable dataset on Kaggle: [Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
*   **Description:** The dataset contains information about loan applications, including applicant demographics, financial history, loan details, and the target variable indicating whether the loan was approved or not.
*   **Features:** The dataset typically includes features like:
    *   `Loan_ID`: Unique loan identifier.
    *   `Gender`: Gender of the applicant.
    *   `Married`: Marital status of the applicant.
    *   `Dependents`: Number of dependents.
    *   `Education`: Education level of the applicant.
    *   `Self_Employed`: Whether the applicant is self-employed.
    *   `ApplicantIncome`: Income of the applicant.
    *   `CoapplicantIncome`: Income of the co-applicant.
    *   `LoanAmount`: Loan amount.
    *   `Loan_Amount_Term`: Term of the loan in months.
    *   `Credit_History`: Credit history of the applicant (e.g., meets guidelines or not).
    *   `Property_Area`: Area where the property is located (e.g., urban, semi-urban, rural).
    *   `Loan_Status`: Loan approval status (e.g., Y/N). This is the target variable.
*   **Potential Limitations:**  This is a relatively small and simplified dataset, so it might not fully capture the complexities of real-world loan eligibility prediction. The dataset might also be synthetically generated or modified for privacy, which could impact its representativeness.

## Project Roadmap

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the loan application dataset, understand its structure, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and potentially scale numerical features.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Create new features if deemed helpful.
4.  **Model Training:** Train Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models to predict loan eligibility.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the models' performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve).
6.  **Interpretation and Insights:** Analyze the models' results, understand feature importance, and draw conclusions.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
train_data = pd.read_csv("train_ctrUa4K.csv")

# Display the first few rows
print(train_data.head())

# Get basic information about the dataset
print(train_data.info())

# Check for missing values
print(train_data.isnull().sum())

# Explore the distribution of the target variable (Loan_Status)
sns.countplot(x='Loan_Status', data=train_data)
plt.show()

# Explore the relationship between other features and Loan_Status using countplots/barplots
# Example: Gender vs. Loan_Status
sns.countplot(x='Gender', hue='Loan_Status', data=train_data)
plt.show()

# Explore numerical features using histograms or boxplots
# Example: ApplicantIncome distribution
sns.histplot(train_data['ApplicantIncome'], bins=50)
plt.show()
````

**Explanation:**

  * We import the necessary libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  * We load the dataset using `pd.read_csv()`.
  * We examine the first few rows, data types, and check for missing values.
  * We visualize the distribution of the target variable (`Loan_Status`) using a countplot.
  * We explore the relationships between other features (e.g., `Gender`, `Married`, `Education`) and `Loan_Status` using countplots or barplots.
  * We examine the distribution of numerical features (e.g., `ApplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`) using histograms or boxplots.

### 2\. Data Preprocessing

```python
# Handle missing values - Example: Impute categorical with mode, numerical with median
for col in ['Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Self_Employed', 'Credit_History']:
    train_data[col].fillna(train_data[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)

for col in ['LoanAmount', 'Loan_Amount_Term']:
    train_data[col].fillna(train_data[col].median(), inplace=True)

# Convert target variable to numerical (Loan_Status: Y=1, N=0)
train_data['Loan_Status'] = train_data['Loan_Status'].map({'Y': 1, 'N': 0})

# Encode categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding
# Example: One-hot encoding for Gender, Married, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area
train_data = pd.get_dummies(train_data, columns=['Gender', 'Married', 'Education', 'Self_Employed', 'Property_Area'], drop_first=True)

# Example: Label encoding for Dependents and Credit_History
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
train_data['Dependents'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_data['Dependents'])
train_data['Credit_History'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(train_data['Credit_History'])

# Drop Loan_ID column
train_data.drop('Loan_ID', axis=1, inplace=True)
```

**Explanation:**

  * **Handling Missing Values:**
      * We impute missing values in categorical columns (e.g., `Gender`, `Married`) with the mode (most frequent value).
      * We impute missing values in numerical columns (e.g., `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`) with the median.
  * **Target Variable Encoding:**
      * We convert the target variable `Loan_Status` to numerical format (1 for 'Y', 0 for 'N').
  * **Categorical Feature Encoding:**
      * We use one-hot encoding for features like `Gender`, `Married`, etc. This creates new binary columns for each category.
      * We use label encoding for ordinal features like `Dependents` or features where we want to represent categories with single integer values `Credit_History`.
  * **Dropping Irrelevant Columns:** We drop the `Loan_ID` column as it's not relevant for prediction.

### 3\. Feature Engineering (Optional)

```python
# Example: Create a new feature 'Total_Income' by combining ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome
train_data['Total_Income'] = train_data['ApplicantIncome'] + train_data['CoapplicantIncome']

# Optional: You can apply log transformation to skewed numerical features to make them more normally distributed
import numpy as np
train_data['LoanAmount_log'] = np.log(train_data['LoanAmount'])
train_data['Total_Income_log'] = np.log(train_data['Total_Income'])
```

**Explanation:**

  * We create a new feature `Total_Income` by combining `ApplicantIncome` and `CoapplicantIncome`. This might be a stronger predictor than individual incomes.
  * (Optional) We apply a log transformation to skewed numerical features like `LoanAmount` and `Total_Income`. This can sometimes improve model performance, especially for linear models like Logistic Regression.

### 4\. Model Training

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Separate features (X) and target (y)
X = train_data.drop('Loan_Status', axis=1)
y = train_data['Loan_Status']

# Scale numerical features (optional but often recommended for Logistic Regression)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Logistic Regression model
lr_model = LogisticRegression()
lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Initialize and train a Decision Tree model
dt_model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
dt_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Explanation:**

  * We separate the features (X) from the target variable (y).
  * We optionally apply `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features. This can be beneficial for Logistic Regression but is not strictly necessary for Decision Trees.
  * We split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
  * We initialize a `LogisticRegression` model and train it using the training data.
  * We initialize a `DecisionTreeClassifier` model and train it using the training data.

### 5\. Model Evaluation

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred_lr = lr_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_dt = dt_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate Logistic Regression
print("Logistic Regression Results:")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_lr))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_lr))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_lr))

# Evaluate Decision Tree
print("\nDecision Tree Results:")
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_dt))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_dt))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred_dt))
```

**Explanation:**

  * We make predictions on the test set using both models.
  * We evaluate the models using:
      * **Accuracy:** The overall percentage of correct predictions.
      * **Classification Report:** Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
      * **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

### 6\. Interpretation and Insights

#### Logistic Regression Feature Importance

```python
# Get feature importances from the Logistic Regression model
feature_importances = pd.DataFrame({'feature': train_data.drop('Loan_Status', axis=1).columns, 'importance': np.abs(lr_model.coef_[0])})
feature_importances = feature_importances.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importances['feature'], feature_importances['importance'])
plt.xlabel("Feature Importance")
plt.ylabel("Feature")
plt.title("Feature Importance in Logistic Regression Model")
plt.show()
```

#### Decision Tree Feature Importance

```python
# Get feature importances from the Decision Tree model
feature_importances_dt = pd.DataFrame({'feature': train_data.drop('Loan_Status', axis=1).columns, 'importance': dt_model.feature_importances_})
feature_importances_dt = feature_importances_dt.sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# Plot feature importances
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importances_dt['feature'], feature_importances_dt['importance'])
plt.xlabel("Feature Importance")
plt.ylabel("Feature")
plt.title("Feature Importance in Decision Tree Model")
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

  * **Logistic Regression:**
      * We extract the coefficients from the trained `LogisticRegression` model. The magnitude of the coefficients indicates the strength of the feature's influence on the prediction.
      * We create a bar plot to visualize feature importances.
  * **Decision Tree:**
      * We extract the feature importances from the trained `DecisionTreeClassifier` model. Feature importances in decision trees are based on how much each feature reduces impurity (e.g., Gini impurity) in the tree's nodes.
      * We create a bar plot to visualize feature importances.

**Interpreting Feature Importance:** Features with higher importance scores have a stronger influence on the model's predictions. This can help us understand which factors are most important in determining loan eligibility.

## Exercises

1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to tune the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models (e.g., `C` for Logistic Regression, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split` for Decision Tree).
2.  **Other Classification Models:** Explore other classification algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Gradient Boosting.
3.  **Cross-Validation:** Use k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Create more potentially useful features. For example, you could create features related to the loan amount to income ratio, or interactions between existing features.
5.  **Handle Class Imbalance:** If the dataset has a significant class imbalance (many more approved loans than rejected loans), try techniques like oversampling the minority class (e.g., using SMOTE) or undersampling the majority class to balance the classes.

## Suggested Solutions (Hints)

  * **Exercise 1:** Refer to the Scikit-learn documentation for `GridSearchCV` and `RandomizedSearchCV`. Define a parameter grid with different hyperparameter values to try.
  * **Exercise 2:** Scikit-learn provides implementations of many classification algorithms.
  * **Exercise 3:** Use `cross_val_score` from Scikit-learn.
  * **Exercise 4:** Think about how different features might interact or how they relate to the applicant's ability to repay the loan.
  * **Exercise 5:** The `imblearn` library provides implementations of oversampling and undersampling techniques.
